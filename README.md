## Powershell Script

There are two `ps1` scripts added for your convenience. To use these:

1. Enter your **server name**, **username** and **password** in each script, and save changes.
2. Run the appropriate script from the root folder, like this:

```bash
# In the root folder
.\Data\RunAll.ps1

# Or
.\Models\RunAll.ps1
```

The generated `txt` files should contain table rows selected. If they contain errors, then use that information to debug the problem - connection errors likely mean the server name, username and/or password are incorrect.
